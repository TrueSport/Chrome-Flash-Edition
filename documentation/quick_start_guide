Quick Start Guide
=================

Welcome to Amp! Before we get started, it's worth noting that there's a lot to
cover. This guide isn't meant to be comprehensive; visit https://amp.rs/docs for
a much more in-depth guide to using Amp.

Right, let's get started. You're currently looking at an open buffer, which can
be scrolled up and down using "," and "m", respectively. Go ahead and try them
now; you're going to use these a lot, and they're the only keys you need to read
the rest of this guide.

Moving the Cursor
=================

You can use the "hjkl" keys to move the cursor left, down, up, and right, just
like in Vim.

You can amplify these movements by holding shift. The "H" and "L" keys will go
to the start and end of the current line, and the "J" and "K" keys will go to
the last and first line, respectively.

You can also use the "w" and "b" keys to move forwards and backwards one word at
a time.

Beyond that, you're going to want to use Amp's jump mode to navigate. This mode
works by prefixing words with a jump token. Type the two letters in the jump
token to move to the word.
